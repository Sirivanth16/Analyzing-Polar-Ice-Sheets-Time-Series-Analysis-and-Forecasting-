This project focuses on assessing the long-term trends and environmental impacts of Arctic sea ice melting using machine learning and statistical techniques. Leveraging data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), the analysis aims to identify patterns in sea ice melting over time and investigate the consequences on Arctic ecosystems, marine life, and human communities. The methodology involves machine learning for trend analysis, environmental impact assessment, and analysis of socio-economic effects on local communities. The project aims to provide comprehensive insights, visualizations, and recommendations for policymakers, bridging the gap between scientific research and public understanding. Ethical considerations and uncertainty analyses are integral components of the project.
